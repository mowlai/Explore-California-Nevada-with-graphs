In this homework, we built a system providing users with information about roads in California and Nevada.
Specifically, the implementation of the system consisted of two parts.

* Backend: where you need to develop efficient algorithms that define the functionalities of the system
* Frontend: where you provide visualization for queries entered by the user

__`Usage instructions (should you want to execute our script):`__

	To run our code it is necessary to download the three datasets and store them in a folder named 'Files', then everything will be automatically processed.
 
This repository includes the following stuff:
1. __`main.py`__: 
     > A main file by which you can run functionalities by picking the one you want.
      
2. __`func_1.py`__:
      > A Python file gathering the functions used to complete the first task. 
      
3. __`func_2.py`__:
      > A Python file containing the functions used to solve the second task.
      
3. __`func_3.py`__:
      > A Python file gathering the functions used to complete the third task. 
      
4. __`func_4.py`__:
      > A Python file containing the functions used to solve the fourth task.
      
5. __`fibonacci_heap.py`__:
      > A library we found online and modified to satisfy our needs.
